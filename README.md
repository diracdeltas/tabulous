This is an ultra-simple Firefox emulation of Chrome OneTab (http://www.one-tab.com/). 

To use, download the .xpi file, install it in Firefox, then click the "T" icon at the bottom right corner to hide all tabs except the active one. Clicking the icon again will show those tabs. 

# TODO
* Create a menu that shows the tabs currently Tabulous-ized, a la OneTab.
* Make the Tabulous icon change color on hover.
* Strictly preserver order of tabs. Currently, the active tab becomes the first (leftmost) tab after toggling Tabulous.
