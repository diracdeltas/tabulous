This is an ultra-simple Firefox emulation of Chrome OneTab (http://www.one-tab.com/). 

To use, download the .xpi file, install it in Firefox, then click the icon at the bottom right corner to hide all tabs except the active one. Clicking the icon again will show those tabs. 

Right now, the icon is the Firefox default. Need to fix that.
